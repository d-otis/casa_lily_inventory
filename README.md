## Overview
- Utilized Sinatra’s un-opinionated framework for a highly customized experience
- Defined endpoints for items, locations, allowing for items to exist in multiple physical storage locations via JOINs
- Provided user control for creation and maintenance of multiple inventory locations and items
- Empowered users to set their own pars for items in each location
- Prepared a specialized route “/shopping-list” that only included needed items and their required quantities
