# To Do

- [x] Create migrations
- [x] Test Migrations
- [x] Seed Data
- [ ] Build method for setting boolean of ```under``` whenever a location_item is updated or created
- [x] build method for totaling inventory across all locations
- [ ] when checking new item in location, need to make sure that count/par entries are still able to be saved in db
- [ ] figure out better user flow so you aren't clicking through so many views when adding/editing Items

## Location Show
- [ ] Should list all items and their # and par in addition to color code if under par
